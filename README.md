There is ability to add custom colors for the columns with options. For example, for "custom_status" with "Draft", "Actual", "Need update", "Outdated" options you can set colors in the next way:

```
"custom_status":{
        "Draft": "fbbc04",
        "Actual": "34a853",
        "Need update": "4285f4",

```
"rules": {
        "Automated": [
            {
                "custom_automation_status": "Automated",
                "custom_status": "Actual"

        ],

                "custom_automation_status": "Not automated",

            }
        ],
