* group_by - test cases are grouped by this field, remove it to skip grouping, it also affects group statistics, #tags are ignored, e.g. "Category #tags" is counted as "Category"
* show_groups - displaying or hiding group names in the report
* show_without_group - displaying or hiding test cases without set group field

### xlsx.json

For adjustment of column width to its content:

* min_width is min column width
* max_width is max column width
* character_width is approximate width of 1 character that is used for calculation

Styles for heading, groups and sections cells:

* heading_style
* group_style
* section_style

There is ability to add custom colors for the columns with options. For example, for "custom_status" with "Draft", "Actual", "Need update", "Outdated" options you can set colors in the next way:

```
"custom_status":{
        "Draft": "fbbc04",
        "Actual": "34a853",
        "Need update": "4285f4",
        "Outdated": "cccccc"
    }
```

### statistics.json

- summary_enabled - enable or disable summary statistics for all tabs
- group_enabled - enable or disable statistics by group for every tabs
- tabName - name of the tab with summary statistics
- column - test case property that is used for statistics
- columnName - name of column that can be added as "statistics_status" to "columns" in report.json
- skipped_status - default value if no rule is applied to test case
- rules describe how test case is counted when calculating statistics
- postfix is used for generating tab name for group statistics

Example of "default" statistics rules: statistics is calculated for "Automated", "Can be automated" and "Not ready for automation" statuses. For "Automated" status only test-cases with "custom_automation_status": "Automated" and "custom_status": "Actual" are counted.

```
"default": {
        "postfix": "",
        "rules": {
            "Automated": [
                {
                    "custom_automation_status": "Automated",
                    "custom_status": "Actual"
                }
            ],
            "Can be automated": [
                {
                    "custom_automation_status": "Not automated",
                    "custom_status": "Actual"
                }
